Savor the image of books on a white linen cloth, carefully arranged. Some have their spines facing upward with a few badges marking the contents, while others show their curved, white pages sparkling with text. A coarse brush is dipped in a bucket of white paint. Large, white letters begin to appear on the surface of the books in sweeping strokes. They form a phrase that reads as both advice and a command: “Write a New Chapter.” 

When you think of what a typographic illustrator does, painting on books is not the first thing that comes to mind. Yet that is precisely the type of creative approach to lettering utilized by Joseph Alessio, a Denver-based illustrator and animator. 

Creating the extraordinary from the ordinary is a specialty of Alessio’s, who has an affinity for analog methods. “I really like working with my hands to begin with, even if something is intended to end as a vector logo,” Alessio said in an interview. 

This enjoyment likely stems from his musical background. Growing up in a large family of seven kids across a broad age-range, his parents chose music as the activity to bring them all together. All of them play string instruments and are multi-instrumental, with Alessio’s “unofficial” instrument count at seven.

“There's something about music in particular that's very personal. And if you play music with people, you really foster a healthy relationship with them,” Alessio said. “That was really valuable. Just getting along with brothers and sisters, you know.”

Alessio often creates illustrations that involve some musical influence, including lettering a quote about music being the “soul to the universe” on a violin in a decorative, script-inspired style. All of that time spent learning music with his family has taught him valuable skills that carry over into his career as a lettering artist. 

“The principles of practice have helped a lot,” Alessio said. “Just the hours spent honing things ... translates very well to something like lettering where it's also very tedious and you want to invest in the minutiae.”

Having worked professionally as a designer and illustrator for four years, he has benefited greatly from the recent popular interest in hand lettering. Search trends for hand lettering have increased 85 percent since 2011, according to Google Trends, and Alessio has been riding the wave. It may have even strongly influenced the trajectory of his entire career.

“I probably would not have seen the possibilities with the more illustrative approach to lettering,” Alessio said regarding the cultural phenomena. “But the great thing about it is that when you think about design history, lettering has always been there whether it’s a trending topic or not.”

Art and illustration is nothing new to Alessio, who’s been drawing since he was a small child. One of his earliest memories involved drawing a picture for his mother with crayons, and bringing it to her while she was cooking. 

“I set it up on the stove over my head and started a little fire there,” Alessio said. “My piece of art was ruined, but thankfully the house did not burn down.”

Despite a strong illustrative bent, he believed at first that web design was the best practical application of his art and design skills. He worked for a while as a web designer at a small agency, but described the work as “soul sucking.” Continuing to explore his passions, he transitioned into a career of illustrated typography and design.

“I didn't realize that you could actually build a career out of it,” Alessio said. “Being self-taught I didn't really get a lot of career information. I don't think even people who go to school get enough information about building a career. Everybody kind of figures it out as they go.”

He has not always been comfortable with that uncertainty. There are often aspects of creative careers that develop in unexpected ways or through mere happenstance. Being a bit of a perfectionist, Alessio craved order. He wanted to know where his life was headed, and to be able to predict where he would end up. He wanted to know the destination. 

This inner struggle led Alessio to create one of the first typographic posters that he shared publicly. It incorporated the following phrase: “Choose your road with care but always choose a destination first.” 

This idea of having the end in mind is something made popular by Stephen Covey in his book “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.” Covey’s theory was that you needed to visualize where you want to go, and then make a plan to get there. You can see how tantalizing this prospect would be for a pedantic creative.

“I was actually kind of crippling myself with that mindset at one point,” Alessio said, describing how he learned the way he tends to operate over time. “I've accepted … that there is a lack of control in everyone's life and you have to be cool with that, and be able to grow along the way without having everything figured out.”

Accepting that uncertainty can be hard. Add on depression and anxiety and it gets harder. Alessio’s personal struggle with depression led him to create a particularly symbolic piece.

“When I made ‘Write A New Chapter’, I wasn't in a very healthy place,” Alessio said. He created the piece around the 2015 New Year, in an effort to overcome negative influences and invest more in himself. “The old books with the pages torn out and the large type brushed over the already existing story felt like a powerful metaphor to me as I set about these goals.”

The career he’s built since includes an array of notable clients including the FYI Television Network, Target, and Walt Disney World. Alessio’s work has been moving more towards animation, in the form of highly shareable GIFs. Yet, even in a digital medium, he hangs on to his analog roots.

“I have a very lo-fi process,” Alessio said, relating his process to that of a scrappy and resourceful member of a garage rock band. “You use what you have at hand. For me it was just take pictures and stick them together in Photoshop.”

Even when Alessio is playing with animation, he is first and foremost focusing on the craft of lettering, which is quite different than simply typing out the phrase on a computer.

A key distinction between lettering, calligraphy, and typeface design is in how it is created. Calligraphy involves letters that are created in a few strokes using a specific tool, such as a broad nib pen or a brush. The calligrapher uses a ductus, or sequence of steps, to create a specific style of writing. 

Type design, on the other hand, involves creating a font, which is a set of interchangeable letters that are meant to work together as a system. Originally, letters were carved into wood or metal, while today they are digitized using vector tools. Every letter in the font is exactly the same, which allows the typesetter—nowadays, anyone with a computer—to recombine them in any order and have them still be functional and appealing.

Lettering is an entirely different animal. It involves drawing each letter, often building up the shape of the letterform using many strokes. The craft of lettering often deviates from the everyday appearance of letters, taking on elements that are more illustrative. Phrases or words take on a whole new graphic form. Letters begin to swirl and curve, or take the shape of objects. 

Alessio often uses real life objects to create his typographic illustrations, everything from snow to literal nuts and bolts. “My aptitude is more towards constructing the forms than writing them,” Alessio said. “Of course keeping the written tradition in mind while doing so.”

Alessio’s first experience with lettering involved a calligraphy book his brother had when he was little. Being left-handed, it was harder to learn how to hold and manipulate the pen to create the letters, so he just traced them.

“I thought I was doing calligraphy wrong,” Alessio said. “I didn’t realize this was a thing called lettering, where we draw the forms and construct them rather than writing them.”

Through carefully studying traditional writing styles and other lettering artists—not to mention lots and lots of practice—Alessio has developed a keen eye for creating letterforms. “You kind of begin to understand how the curves flow, both from the hand and just the way that the eye perceives them,” Alessio said. 

Throngs of new letterers have jumped on the bandwagon of the hand lettering trend, but to truly succeed with illustrated typography—or anything for that matter—one needs to be passionate about the pursuit. This passion is what will separate the true craftspeople from the rest when the trend shifts back towards modernism, Alessio says. 

One example of this shift in design history is with Jan Tschichold, a German typographer who pioneered modernist typographic design during WWII. Tschichold was the son of a sign painter and trained as a calligrapher, but eventually veered towards the stark aesthetic of Swiss design. Later in life, he swung towards more ornate designs influenced by the human hand in reaction to the militaristic harshness and modernist style adopted by the Nazi regime. 

Tschichold’s reaction, while unique in circumstance, is not unique when looking at the culture at large. The pendulum of aesthetic style often shifts sides as a reaction to what came before. 

“I feel like we’re kind of on the cusp of giving up on the whole handmade, vintage aspect—because there is just so much of it—and going back to a much more modernist sensibility,” Alessio said. “I’m almost looking forward to the trend kind of settling down a little. Let the dust settle, you know.

“People will stop doing it just to do it, and the people that are really interested in it, because they love it, will stand out more.”

Looking to the future, Alessio is planning to branch out and try some new approaches to lettering, including public art projects. “People look at [the work] in a different light if it’s on a large scale, or if it's in a different medium,” Alessio said. 

Even if Alessio’s prediction comes true, he isn’t worried about lettering becoming unnecessary. “[Lettering] will always be necessary because people always read. People always want to see words,” Alessio said. “It’s just we have to figure out how to continue to make it relevant.”
