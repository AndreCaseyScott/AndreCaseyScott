For the past few years, Eugene has been home to an continuing boom of technology companies flocking to the area. Enough software businesses, game development firms, and other tech-heavy outfits have moved in that some have dubbed Eugene the “Silicon Shire.” A nickname that hopes to draw attention to our small city and encourage even more growth in the local tech industry. But with all this growth from tech startups, what is the impact on graphic designers?

Courtney Stubbert, local visual artist and creative director at Artsdigital, suggests that what it means to design is changing and that the industry should be prepared for, and open minded to, new opportunities.
“To think of yourself as a Graphic Designer, and just decide that that’s all I'm going to be, is insanely short sighted,” Stubbert says. “A graphic designer now means a thousand different things depending on what link you click on. You can click on a graphic design job posting on some site and they will need someone who just does CSS and HTML, or it could be someone who needs an identity and branding package … It's so random what it means.”

Stubbert started doing graphic design back in the late ‘90s. “We were still doing hand-cut Amberlith color separations, and I think Photoshop was on Photoshop 2,” Stubbert says of his beginnings in the industry. Now he is designing websites for clients, in addition to branding and other visual design work. 
This shift in the industry isn’t exactly new and surprising, but it’s getting harder to ignore the change. For decades, the craft of graphic design used physical materials that utilized hand skills closely related to drawing, but in the past 10 to 20 years this has changed significantly. Now, most design work is created using computer applications like Photoshop and Illustrator, with designers increasingly expected to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript for digital mediums. 

“Learning to code is a no-brainer. A non-starter. Even I've started to get myself refreshed on some of the basics,” Subbert says. 

New technologies have always been the cornerstone of the graphic design industry. Driven by a cultural desire to spread information, innovations in printing have radically changed the world several times over. Humans keep finding new ways to spread visual communication faster, cheaper, and more effectively, and with that comes exciting new challenges for designers.

John Maeda, the global head of Computational Design and Inclusion at Automattic—the company behind Wordpress—thinks that designers are going to play an increasing role in technology-based businesses in the near future. 

“Experience and design have become a priority for all kinds of businesses because so many aspects of the technological revolution have become commoditized,” Maeda says in a LinkedIn article about the recently released 2017 Design in Tech Report. “When a technology matures, that’s when design becomes especially relevant as the differentiating factor. That time, for tech, is now.”
Simply put, businesses need designers to help them stand out from the pack. This is due to the underlying technology that many businesses use being fundamentally the same, with no discernible difference to consumers. 

One example of this is Wordpress, a popular content management system that is used by roughly 27 percent of all websites. As far as users are concerned it’s just a website, but with over a quarter of the Internet powered by the same software, good design is how companies stay competitive.
Yet there are many business that still don’t fully understand the importance of paying for good design, especially in the Eugene area. 

“Part of it is just population—[Eugene’s] a small town—But a lot of the agencies [I’ve interacted with] are not design-led,” Subbert says. Meaning that many local agencies approach client projects from a marketing perspective, and do not believe that design is a worthwhile thing to sell, Stubbert says. Having mostly local or regional clients with limited budgets doesn’t help. 

“It is an investment not an expense, and finding people who understand expense versus investment is hard. Especially in Eugene,” Stubbert says. 

87 percent of start-ups believe that design is important, if not very important, according to a 2016 survey on The Future of Design in Startups. So it’s safe to say that everyone agrees that design matters. The problem here that most local startups currently are “tech-heavy,” with very few designers on staff.
It's only the big cities where tech companies spend money on visual design, Stubbert says. “There aren't enough [local] leaders with money to throw down stakes for [design]—yet.”

For many designers entering the field, the prospect of learning to code can be off putting. Most start designing because they love creating visually, and are not necessarily interested in the hyper-technical, often text-based world of web design. Yet with two-fifths of designers now involved with code development, having at least a baseline understanding of web languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript is becoming more important, if only to better communicate with programmers on projects. 

Luckily, designers are well equipped to adapt to this new landscape. As cultural producers, designers are visual communicators, and to be a good communicator requires empathy.

“Empathy in all things is vastly important when it comes to design. Be it graphic, be it strategic, be it digital, be it code, web, experience, environment, architecture, medical systems—I don't care. Empathy is really important,” Stubbert says. 

It’s also important to keep in mind that analog mediums are not going away anytime soon, and learning to combine print assets with digital design can be an important aspect of helping clients stand out. 
“People want something physical and tangible … [and] trying to find ways to integrate the real and the digital is important. Think about the touch points that you create for a client,” Stubbert says, “all those little brochures, and pieces of paper. How can you make those things unique and interesting?”
Designers have always been an adaptive and innovative breed, and will continue to be sought after for those qualities. While it’s likely that local tech firms will be hiring more as they mature, one thing is certain: they won’t be looking for people who are just graphic designers.
